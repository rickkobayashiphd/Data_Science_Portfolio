## Current Data Science Projects: An adventure into patience and understanding

### Project 1: Machine Learning Lab

"A not-so-serious tool to find Machine Learning Lab friends"

![Professor Mandel's Machine Learning Lab](images/lab.png)

* Showcased a tool that uses an API to create images from text
* Thank you to RoboHash for this free resource https://robohash.org/

### Project 2: Image Detection Powered By AI

"Using the Clarifai deep learning AI platform"

![Clarifai API](images/clarifai.png)

* Showcased a tool that uses the Clarifai deep learning AI platform and its API to predict with some probability the contents of the .jpg image
* Thank you to Clarifai for this free resource https://www.clarifai.com/

### [Project 3: Google CoLab project using Kaggle's Natural Language Processing Dataset(work in progress)](https://github.com/rickkobayashiphd/nlp)

![[Kaggle)](images/kaggle.png)

* Predicted with some measure of probability which tweets are disasters and which tweets are not disasters
* Thank you to Kaggle for this free dataset https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data

### [Project 4: Google Colab project to test models on PubMed Abstract datasets(work in progress)](https://github.com/rickkobayashiphd/pubmed)

![Model](images/model.png "Logo Title")

* Attempted to model the Franck Dernoncourt and Ji Young Lee 2017 research paper, "PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts." 
* Compared the success of multiple models against a baseline in their ability to categorize and assign a heading to the sentences contained in PubMed abstracts.
* Thank you to Franck Dernoncourt for providing access to this dataset https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/pubmed-rct

## **About**

I am your hard-working PhD, problem solver, and aspiring Data Scientist. I help people work. I seek an internship or volunteer position where I can become better at solving complex problems and serve others with actionable data-driven guidance. 

I've served as a family restaurant owner at Cafe 100, continued as an electrician apprentice for Light Workers Electric (License C-32190), and currently work as the CAD/CAM Operations Manager and Carpenter for RK Builders (License BC-7556).  

As a supportive employer, technician, and small business owner who has trekked through the hills and valleys of the entrepreneurial landscape, I would be truly grateful to continue this journey with you, serving as your Data Science doer.

Well, if you made it this far, here is a shameless plug. I am the co-founder of a Hawaiian Hardwood guitar company with my best friend, Jeremiah Augustine. “When you are done playing everything else, then play TigerLuv Guitars.”
