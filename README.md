## Current Data Science Projects: An adventure in patience and understanding

### [Project 1: Machine Learning Lab](https://github.com/rickkobayashiphd/mandel)

"A not-so-serious tool to find Machine Learning Lab friends"

![Professor Mandel's Machine Learning Lab](images/lab.png)

* Showcased a tool that uses an API to create images from text
* Thank you to RoboHash for this free resource https://robohash.org/

### Project 2: Image Detection Powered By AI(work in progress)

"Using the Clarifai deep learning AI platform"

![Clarifai API](images/clarifai.png)

* Showcased a tool that uses the Clarifai deep learning AI platform and its API to predict with some probability the contents of the .jpg image
* Thank you to Clarifai for this free resource https://www.clarifai.com/

### [Project 3: Google CoLab project using Kaggle's Natural Language Processing Dataset(work in progress)](https://github.com/rickkobayashiphd/nlp)

![[Kaggle)](images/kaggle.png)

* Predicted with some measure of probability which tweets are disasters and which tweets are not disasters
* Thank you to Kaggle for this free dataset https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data

### [Project 4: Google Colab project to test models on PubMed Abstract datasets(work in progress)](https://github.com/rickkobayashiphd/pubmed)

![Model](images/model.png "Logo Title")

* Attempted to model the Franck Dernoncourt and Ji Young Lee 2017 research paper, "PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts." 
* Compared the success of multiple models against a baseline in their ability to categorize and assign a heading to the sentences contained in PubMed abstracts.
 Thank you to Franck Dernoncourt for providing access to this dataset https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/pubmed-rct
